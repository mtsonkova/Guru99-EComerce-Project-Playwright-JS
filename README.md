# Guru99 EComerce Project test automation with Playwright

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to perform E2E test automation for the [Guru99 EComerce project](http://live.techpanda.org/index.php/). Subscription for this project is available [here](https://www.guru99.com/live-ecommerce-project.html). Note that it is originally oriented towards Selenium and Java, but I choose to automate it on Playwright with JavaScript.

**Tools,Platforms, Browsers**
 - Language: JavaScript
 - Framework: Playwright
 - Platform: Windows
 - Browser: Chrome

**In scope:**

- E2E Web UI

**Out of scope:**

-API

**NOTE:** GURU 99 does not provide any documentation for this project at all in comparason with other their projects like [GURU 99 Bank Project](https://www.guru99.com/live-selenium-project.html).

-Database
**NOTE:** Guru99 provides a password to access the database but only for a limited period of time. Therefore test cases that include or rely on database products manipulation are expected to fail after the provided password expires.

**Test cases to automate:**
 - Manual test cases authored by me.
 - Test cases, provided by Guru99 as part of their timeboxed live project demo. Tests, related to database changes will be excluded.
